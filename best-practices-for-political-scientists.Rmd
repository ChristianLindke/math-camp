# A Quick Overview...
1. Code well
2. Write using plain text
3. Use a version control system 

# Code well - DO NOT CLICK A MOUSE
* All results should be replicable from a source file
* These source files (for example, .R for R scripts or .do for Stat do-files) should be liberally commented
* Comments explain what you are doing to your future self, collaborators, and others 

# Comment example
```
# This code creates Fig 1
# I use the mtcars dataset (included with R)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") # Adds OLS line with SEs
ggsave("fig/fig1.pdf")
```
* Save this code snippit as `fig1.R` (or similar)

# Literate programming and reproducible research 
* Previous example - have two files for one plot in a paper
    + The paper itself (document.tex or similar)
    + the script to create the figure (fig1.R or similar)
* What if we could combine these to have everything in one easy-to-read file? 
    + This is what literate programming is all about!

# Literate programming example (using `knitr`)

```
\begin{section}
This is an example paragraph, writte in \LaTeX. 
Using knitr, we can include R code in the following manner.
I can reference the figure number by calling ref:
Figure \ref{fig:mpg-and-weight}. 
% NTS - updating that figure with squared x doesn't change it 
\begin{figure}
\centering
<<fig1plot>>= 
# I use the mtcars dataset (included with R)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") # Adds OLS line with SEs
@
\caption{Miles per gallon and weight}
\label{fig:mpg-and-weight}
\end{figure}
```

# Version Control
* **YOU NEED TO USE VERSION CONTROL!!!!!**
* This can be as simple as putting things in Dropbox, which enables you to recover previous file versions automatically
* Word's "track changes" feature... 

# Pathologies of the Dropbox/Word approach:
* Assumes they're both going to be around (in the same form(ish)) in the future
    + Remember computers 20 years ago???
* You can "clobber" work (save over good work)
* Must tell coauthors not to touch files while you're working on them
    + Though this may be changing...
* You also tend to end up with many versions of the same project
    + ((show example paper))

# Git (and Github)
* Git is a formal *distributed version control system*
* It is an easy way to keep track of all the revisions you have saved
* It enables easy collaborating between many different people, without the need to email files back and forth or tell them when you're working on something 
* You only have *one* version of a file at any one time
* You can see the entire history of a file easily
* You can see exactly what changed in each new commit
