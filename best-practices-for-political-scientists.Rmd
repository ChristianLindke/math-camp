# A Quick Overview...
1. Code well
2. Write using plain text
3. Use a version control system 

# Code well - DO NOT CLICK A MOUSE
* All results should be replicable from a source file
* These source files (for example, .R for R scripts or .do for Stat do-files) should be liberally commented
* Comments explain what you are doing to your future self, collaborators, and others 

# Comment example
```
# This code creates Fig 1
# I use the mtcars dataset (included with R)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method="lm") # Adds OLS line with SEs
ggsave("fig/fig1.pdf")
```
* Save this code snippit as `fig1.R` (or similar)

# Literate programming and reproducible research 
* Previous example - have two files for one plot in a paper
    + The paper itself (document.tex or similar)
    + the script to create the figure (fig1.R or similar)
* What if we could combine these to have everything in one easy-to-read file? 
    + This is what literate programming is all about!

# Literate programming example (using `knitr`)

```
\begin{section}
This is an example paragraph, writte in \LaTeX. 
Using knitr, we can include R code in the following manner.
I can reference the figure number by calling ref:
Figure \ref{fig:mpg-and-weight}. 
% NTS - updating that figure with squared x doesn't change it
