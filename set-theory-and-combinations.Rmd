# Set Theory
## What is it?
### Intro to Set Theory
* What is set theory?
* A branch of mathematics 
* Collects objects into *sets* and studies the properties 

### What's a set? 
* A **set** is a collection of objects 
$$
S = \left\{ s_1, s_2, s_3, ... s_n \right\}
$$
* The objects can be anything
* We usually use variables or units of observation 

### Elements in or not
* We can say whether an object is in a set or not:
$$
s_{13} \in S
$$
* Or not:
$$
q_{1} \notin S
$$

## Subsets
### Subsets
* We can divide sets into *subsets*
$$
M \subset S
$$
* $M$ is a *proper subset* of $S$ iff all elements of $M$ are in $S$ but not all elements of $S$ are in $M$. 
* We can also define non-proper subsets:
$$
L \subseteq S
$$

## Set universes
### Empty sets
* Some sets contain no elements
* For example, cities on Earth with average temperatures of greater than 1000 degrees
  + Though Austin might be close... 
$$
Z = \left\{ \emptyset \right\}
$$

### Set Universes
* We can talk about how subsets fill a certain **universe** of possibilities
* For example:
$$
R = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
$$
* $R$ represents all the possibilities of a (single) roll of a die 
* We can define sets for the even possibilities and the odd possibilities
$$
E = \left\{ 2,4,6 \right\} \qquad O = \left\{ 1,3,5 \right\}
$$

### Compliments
* A *compliment* is that together, they contain all the elements of the relevant universe 
$$
E = O^C \qquad ; \qquad O = E^C
$$

## Graphical representation
### Universe
* Board examples of how to draw sets

## Intersection, Disjoint, unions
* Intersections: $A \cap B$ includes all the common elements of $A$ and $B$
    + If $A \cap B = \emptyset$, then they are **disjoint**
* Unions: $A \cup B$ contains all the elements of both $A$ and $B$
    + Two sets unions can't be empty (unless both sets are empty to begin with)
* Size: $n(R)=6$ tells us that there are 6 elements in $R$
* Sizes of unions
    + $n(x \cup Y) = n(X) + n(Y) - n(X \cap Y)$
    + Have to subtract the last term, otherwise we'd double-count elements in the intersection of the two sets
    
## Properties of Unions, Intersections
### Properties
* $A \cup B = B \cup A$
* $A \cap B = B \cap A$
* $(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)$
* $(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)$
* $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
* $A \cup (C \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$
