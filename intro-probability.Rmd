# What is probability?
### Probability
* Frequency with which an event occurs
* Typically:
$$
Pr(A) = P(A) = \pi(A) = \dfrac{\text{Number of ways an event can occur}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
$$
* There are other ways of thinking about probability, but we'll stick with this one

# Probability Distributions
## Discrete
### Discrete probabilities 
* What's the probability that we'll roll a 3 on one die roll:
$$
Pr(y=3) = \dfrac{1}{6}
$$

* If one roll of the die is an "experiment"
* We can think of a 3 as a "success"
* And $Y \sim Bern(\dfrac{1}{6})$
* Fair coins are $\sim Bern(.5)$ for example
* More generally $Bern(\pi)$
    + $\pi$ represents the probability of success

### Binomial distributions
* Before we ran the experiment just once
* What happens if we run it multiple times?
$$
Pr(y_1=3, y_2=3) = \dfrac{1}{6} * \dfrac{1}{6}
$$
* Now $Y \sim Binom(2, \dfrac{1}{6})
    + Generally, $Y \sim Binom(n, p)$
    + n = number of trials, p = probability of success
* PMF:
$$
{n \choose k} p^k (1-6)^{n-k}
$$
