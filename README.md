# .Rmd files
You can compile .Rmd files in Rstudio. Open them and click the "Knit PDF" button. Note that you'll need a LaTeX distribution installed to do this. I recommend [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), which is available for all major operating systems.  

If you want an OS-specific TeX distribution, there is MiKTex for Windows and MaCTeX for Mac.
