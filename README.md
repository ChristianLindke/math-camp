This repository holds some of the documents for Introduction to Math for Political Scientists.

# .Rmd files
You can compile .Rmd files in Rstudio. Open them and click the "Knit PDF" button. Note that youl'll need a LaTeX distrobution installed to do this. I recommend [MikTex](http://miktex.org/) for Windows, and [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) for Mac and Linux.
